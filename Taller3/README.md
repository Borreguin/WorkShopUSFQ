The GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) package is intended for solving large-scale linear programming (LP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and other related problems. It is a set of routines written in ANSI C and organized in the form of a callable library.
This project uses this Linear Programming Kit to solve large-scale problems related to Logistics. 

The installation of this package depends on the Operating System:

Windows: https://winglpk.sourceforge.net/
